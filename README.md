# XAI-DF-Project

NOTE: Reference Research Article: "Towards a Unified XAI-based Framework for Digital Forensic Investigations"

The XAI-DF project is initiated as an open-source resource of digital forensic images to be utilized for (but not limited to) training XAI models used in DF investigations. We created an initial memory database of 27 dumps (database can be accesed via project link provided in the research article, features extracted from the dumps can be downloaded from this repository) that focuses on malware activity in the memory. With the progression of time, this is intended to be used as a base to build upon a more vast database consisting of forensic images of both memory and other sub-disciplines such as network, hard drive/disk space, smartphones, IoT, multimedia, blockchain, etc.

Since the XAI-DF project is a collaborative effort, members of the forensics community are urged to contribute with forensic images (of all types) by uploading them to the project link. This will help achieve its intended purpose of providing researchers and practitioners with a vast database of DF images for XAI. Forensics research, in general, may also greatly benefit from such a database in many ways.
